# Lending-Club-Loan
## The Data  We will be using a subset of the LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club 


Our Goal 

Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), we will build a model that can predict whether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan? This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan. 

For this i used,
Numpy
Pandas
Matplolib
Seaborn
Tensorflow 2.0
Keras
