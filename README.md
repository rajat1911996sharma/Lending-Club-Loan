# Lending-Club-Loan
## The Data  We will be using a subset of the LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club  ## NOTE: Do not download the full zip from the link! We provide a special version of this file that has some extra feature engineering for you to do. You won't be able to follow along with the original file!  LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California.[3] It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.  ### Our Goal  Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), can we build a model thatcan predict wether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan? This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan. Keep in mind classification metrics when evaluating the performance of your model!
